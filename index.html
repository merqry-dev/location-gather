        <h1>Location information test while using Starlink</h1>
        <p style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">This test was created for the purpose of gathering data on how
            location information can be obtained while the
            user is connected through Starlink. Please click the "Fetch the location data" and accept the location
            gathering popup as well as answer the questioner. If possible open the site on a desktop computer / laptop
            and a device with gps like a smartphone. The
            data collected will be sent to an Azure database and after the experiment removed from there and stored
            locally. The location information will be kept confidential, I will use it only to compare how different
            methods for collecting location data differ between each other when run on different devices. The data
            collected using GEOIP and location request is logged to console for inspection.</p>
